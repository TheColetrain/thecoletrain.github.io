#  APT Cacher NG - About and "How To"

## Overview of APT cacher NG
APT-Cacher-NG is designed to cache Ubuntu, Debian and other Linux distrobutions and packages locally.  When one of your machines updates, those updates are stored here.  The next machine that is the same or similar can pull from the cache locally, instead of going out to the internet again. 

## My Pupose & Goals
1. Quite honestly, my main purpose was becasue it seemed like fun to do.
2. It does speed up package downloads, but my internet is good, that really isnt a big deal for me.
3. We are helping Linux, being a good steward of the internet.  If we all do this, that will be less download bandwidth on these distro's.  That will allow them to designate resources elsewhere than handling all the requests.

## Reccomendation.  Should you do this on your server? (Or rasberry Pie, or whtever)
### Short answer is YES! (If you know "you are doing this" and need a guide, skip over the rest of this section and get to the "How To area".)
- I will guide you through a "basic" method, this method will have you set up and running in minutes!  Roughly only a few *copy pasta* steps to get APT Casher NG running!  The basic method is so easy, even I can do it. So for the time spent to get anything done is a WIN.  Amount Cached / Time Spent = Winner Winner Chicken dinner.
- I will also then advise of the advanced options and "tweeks" if you want to mess with it further.  If you want it to be as efficient as possible.
### The long answer is maybe...
- **Phase 1** If you do the short initial version that I will propose, your cache percentages will not be that significant.  (My personal data will be below)  i.e. you won't cache everything. The tradeoff is how EASY this first version is.  So, you can set up a LXC that caches using scripts and copy/paste in minutes, and if it caches anyting at all... that's a win!  The LXC will take very little resources and not that much storage, and you lost little time.... = win.
- **Phase 2** If you go to the next phase, you can precache a little more, wont take any more CPU or RAM, but it will take a couple Gig's of storage.  Not that much harder.  Once more copy/paste, and press a GUI button.
- **Phase 3** Phase three gets a little tricky.  This is where you are "going for it"  Trying to cache everything under the sun and satisfy all of your obsessive compulsive desires. I tried this level and got sick of it, turned it off.  This involves having updates fail, and then going in to the settings and updating them to resolve.  Quite honestly, I dont much know what I am doing, perhaps someone with a little knowlege would say *"It's so easy, you dont know what you are talking about,"* and they would be Right!
### This wont cache HTTPS, it will only cache HTTP. 


## HOW TO DO IT
- **Phase 1** 
1. I have proxmox. I like Proxmox.  I like LXC's.  I like "easy."  Paste this script into your main PVE console. 
```
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/raw/main/ct/apt-cacher-ng.sh)"
```
If you have not heard of Proxmox Helper Scripts, you should look around at that some more when you are done with this!  (*A lot of these were created by, and Used to be run by *tteck*, if that helps ring a bell.*)  [Proxmox Helper Scripts - APT Cacher NG](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=apt-cacher-ng) *You can trust me, of course, but don't trust every random script on the internet!*
:-)
Cant get easier than **Copy Pasta** Right?  Follow the prompts.

2. When that install finishes, you will get something like this.


  üöÄ  Apt-Cacher-NG setup has been successfully initialized!
  üí°   Access it using the following URL:
    üåê  http://192.168.1.215:3142/acng-report.html

Click the link, or type/paste in a web browser.  This is the Apt Cache GUI.  You won't have anything there yet.  So just save it or note it for later.
- Also, make sure you have set up a DHCP reservation, or go in and make a static IP, so the IP doesnt change on you.

3. In the console of your newly created LXC, other than the GUI, (above) this will be where you go to update.  You wont have to go thereunless you choose Phase 2 & 3.  
**`/etc/apt-cacher-ng/acng.conf`**
Its just of note.  The default config is 'PassThroughPattern: .*' This allows all HTTPS to pass.  (No errors, updates just work. I.e. the update will update.)

4. The server is set!  I told you that was easy.  The final step of **Phase 1**,  is to update the client.  Here is the easy way, and then I will explain.
This is the command. paste this in the CLIENT.
```bash
echo 'Acquire::http::Proxy "http://192.168.1.215:3142";' | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/02proxy
```
(above) Update the IP, to your server IP  (step 2) But that is it.  You are done with **Level 1 / Phase 1**  You are caching.  Run an update on the newly configured client, and then go back to your GUI and see how you did!  `http://192.168.1.215:3142/acng-report.html`
